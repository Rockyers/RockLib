# RockLib

Welcome the RockLib! The general use library created by me! (Rockyers) 

This is not the best Library out there honestly, this is just a project I'm working on for expierence and the fun of it! But if you want to give any feedback or want to contribute to the project at all feel free to add me on discord: Rockyers#1000 (If this becomes popular enough I might make a discord server!)

If you find a bug you can make an issue report! I am currently working on the documentation in the wiki section

(Check the wiki or the badge below to get instal instructions)
